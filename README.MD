# NotoSansJP WebFonts

NotoSansJP otf fonts that I manually converted to the assorted corresponding
webfonts using the [font generator found here](https://github.com/bdusell/webfont-generator)

- I slightly modified the setup.sh to work with a newer version of java to compile one of the tools, see those changes in my [clone of his repository](https://github.com/Nathan-Yorio/webfont-generator-pom-fix-2023)
- original otf files are in `OTF`
- generated @fontface CSS in `CSS`
- `shell.sh` contains conversion commands
- generated webfonts in `WEB`
